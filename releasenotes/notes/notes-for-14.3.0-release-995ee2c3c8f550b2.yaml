    This release updates the os-brick library used by Cinder to version
    2.8.7 to correct hopefully the final problem with the fix for
    `Bug #1823200
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_ in the previous
    os-brick release.

    See the `os-brick 2.8.7 release notes
    <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/os-brick/stein.html#relnotes-2-8-7-stable-stein>`_
    for more information.
